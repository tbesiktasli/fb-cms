Interface is simply a context menu, that gives the following possibilities:
- add a new page
- switch to a page
- edit page settings
- add new element (list of html tags)
- remove an element

- HTML changes to the app are directly saved to html!
- No DB needed to hold information about elements
- This is done by DOM manipulation (PHP DOM class) and rendered directly into source code.
- All user added elements get special IDs, so that they are highlighted and can be selected for editing.
